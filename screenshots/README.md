Screenshots
===========

Place UI screenshots in this folder for docs/PRs.

Conventions
- Filenames: `yyyy-mm-dd-page-or-feature.png` (kebab-case).
- Keep images under ~2 MB each where possible.
- Avoid including sensitive data in screenshots.

Tips
- For full-page shots, include viewport width in the filename, e.g., `2025-08-10-home-375w.png`.
- Prefer PNG for crisp UI; use JPG for large photos.
